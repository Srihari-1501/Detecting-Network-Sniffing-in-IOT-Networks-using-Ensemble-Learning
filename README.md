# Detecting-Network-Sniffing-in-IOT-Networks-using-Ensemble-Learning
As smart devices grow, Wi-Fi faces stealthy sniffing threats. Traditional tools miss them, so we used MLâ€”cleaned data, built models from Decision Tree to Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Results show strong potential for securing IoT networks.
